# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is designed to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets. Using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP), this repository contains code that processes, analyzes, and classifies Twitter tweets into various sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral). The aim is to understand the public sentiment about specific topics, trends, or entities.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scripts to collect tweets using Twitter API.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing tweet data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying tweets based on sentiment using machine learning models.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts that represent the sentiment analysis results.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports or dashboards that summarize the findings.
